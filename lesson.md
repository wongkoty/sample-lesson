### Making files and folders from the command line 

For most people, we create files from our programs that we run on our computers (microsoft word, excel, powerpoint) and we create folders to organize our files. But today, we will learn how to do these things in the terminal.

To open our terminal do the below:

- Lets hit <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> together to open our 
- Type in "terminal" in our searchbar and open up that application
- A terminal like the one above should appear!

Althoguh there are multiple ways to open our terminal, we'll stick to this one as I believe it is quick, efficient, and by default all macs should come with this function. 

By default, the terminal should say last login and give the name of the user you are currently logged in as. If it doesn't, don't sweat it for now as we can change that later. 

### Let's go into our desktop and create a folder!

In our terminal type:
```bash 
    $ pwd
```

`pwd` should Print Working Directory, which means it is the current directory that we are in. 

Next lets go into our desktop.

In terminal type:
```bash
    $ cd Desktop
```
